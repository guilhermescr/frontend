# ✨ Frontend Concepts

A personal space to explore and practice frontend development concepts.  
This isn't a full project — it's my learning playground. I'm using it to take notes, write examples, and solidify my understanding of important technologies.

## 🌱 What is this?

Just a repo where I:

- Take notes on frontend topics
- Practice key concepts with small examples
- Document what I learn in a simple way

## 💡 Inspired by

This idea was inspired by [Front Tech Concepts](https://front-tech-concepts.vercel.app/) by [Renato Khael](https://github.com/renatokhael).  
I loved the format and decided to build my own version to help me learn better.

## 📘 Topics I'm learning

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- Redux
- Performance
- Escalabilidade
- Arquiteturas Frontend

## 🤓 Why this repo?

Because learning is better when it's hands-on and well organized.  
This helps me revisit, review, and grow as a frontend dev — at my own pace.
